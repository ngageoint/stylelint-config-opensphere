# stylelint-config-opensphere

## About

This config extends [stylelint-config-standard](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) to meet the SCSS style guidelines used by [OpenSphere](https://github.com/ngageoint/opensphere).

## Usage

To use this configuration, add this project and [stylelint](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint) as dev dependencies.

```
yarn add -D stylelint stylelint-config-opensphere
```

Then add a script to your project's `package.json` to lint your SCSS. It may also be useful to add a script to auto-fix issues.

```
"lint:css": "stylelint 'scss/**/*.scss'",
"lint:css-fix": "stylelint --fix 'scss/**/*.scss'"
```
